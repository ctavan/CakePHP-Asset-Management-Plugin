p This module adds additional functionality to the for loop:
p of operator for looping through arrays. The first parameter will refer to the element itself, and an optional 2nd paramter will refer to the index:
textarea

  A = [7,3,4]

  // will log 14
  for x of A
    sum += x
  log sum     

  // will log 3
  for x, i of A
    sum += i
  log sum

p Kaffeine also provides a second optional second parameter for the in keyword, containing the value:

textarea
  A = [7,3,4]
  z = ""

  // will log 734
  for key, val in A
    zip += val
