h3 Using keyword

p The using keyword imports functions from an object into the current scope. For example if we have a library called "ninja" which exposes two methods jump and kick.

textarea
  using * from require "ninja"
  jump "high"
  kick()

p If we only wanted to import jump, we could write: 

textarea 
  using jump from require "ninja"
  jump "high"

p Note: that the * form uses eval, so it wonâ€™t work with ES5 strict, and also be careful putting it in sections of code that are often called.
